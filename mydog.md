### My biggest son

Born Janary 11th, Such an angel come to my home when he is 3 months old. He is a mix of golden retriver and labrador. He got a specific name --- goldador
When I first take him home, he puked all over my car because he was sick of driving. I took him to the shower, then he poop in my home when I just look away. I can't take a breath when he needs my help. I trained him the correct way pooping and potty.
